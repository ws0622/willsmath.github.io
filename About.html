<h2>About Me</h2>

<!-- Creating the paragraph -->
<p> I was born in Pensacola, Florida where my father was an airline 
mechanic and my mother was a school nurse. Around 2009 my dad 
got offered a position at Delta Airlines, this caused us to move 
to Newnan, Georgia where I spent most of my childhood. This is 
where I found my love for computers and pretty much anything IT 
related. I spent most of my free time in middle and High school 
trying to tinker with my computer or build other peoples PCs for 
spending money. Around High School is when I found my love for cars
and basketball as well, so most of my free time consisted of playing basketball,
working on computers, or helping my dad tinker with his car.

All of my friends ended up going to Kennesaw State because of their well
known IT program, so I followed suit and went there as well. Now I am in my fourth 
year here and have loved every second of it! I have also been involved in a few 
extracurricular activities including the Rec Sports leagues that KSU offers along
with working at AutoZone Part-Time for the past 3 years. Now I am actively looking
for any sort of internship to get more experience and to learn more about the field.
